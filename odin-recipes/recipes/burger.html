  <h4>Description of the recipe:</h4>
  <p>A juicy beef patty grilled to perfection, topped with melted cheddar, crisp lettuce, tomato, and a smear of tangy sauce.</p>
  <p>The perfect recipe for a sunny day out; not too time-consuming, yet so tasty.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients needed:</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>Ground Beef</li>
   <li>Buns</li>
   <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
   <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
   <li>Lettuce</li>
   <li>Onion</li>
   <li>Butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps in order:</h4>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Season the beef.</strong> Form the ground beef into patties (about 1/3 lb each) and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
   <li><strong>Preheat the pan.</strong> Heat your grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the surface to prevent sticking.</li>
   <li><strong>Cook the patties.</strong> Place the patties on the grill or pan, cooking for 3-4 minutes on the first side. Flip the patties and cook another 3-4 minutes, or until desired doneness.</li>
   <li><strong>Add cheese.</strong> During the last minute of cooking, add a slice of cheddar cheese on top of each patty and cover with a lid to melt the cheese.</li>
   <li><strong>Assemble the burger.</strong> Spread your favorite sauce (ketchup, mayo, etc.) on the bottom bun. Add the lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onion. Place the cheesy patty on top, then cover with the top bun.</li>
