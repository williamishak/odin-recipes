  <h4>Description of the recipe:</h4>
  <p>A deliciously cheesy pizza topped with rich tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and a sprinkle of basil, baked to a crispy, golden perfection.</p>
  <p>Ideal for satisfying your cravings with every bite!</p>
  <h4>Ingredients needed:</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>Pizza Dough</li>
   <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
   <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
   <li>Olive Oil</li>
   <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps in order:</h4>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Preheat the oven.</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C), and if using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.</li>
   <li><strong>Prepare the dough.</strong> Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface until it's about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
   <li><strong>Spread the sauce.</strong> Evenly spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving about 1/2 inch of space around the edges for the crust.</li>
   <li><strong>Add cheese and toppings.</strong> Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the sauce, followed by any additional toppings of your choice (like pepperoni, veggies, or garlic).</li>
   <li><strong>Drizzle with olive oil.</strong> Lightly drizzle olive oil over the pizza to enhance the flavor and help the cheese brown.</li>
   <li><strong>Bake the pizza.</strong> Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
   <li><strong>Serve.</strong> Let the pizza cool for a minute, slice, and enjoy!</li>
